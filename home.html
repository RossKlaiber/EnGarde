            <h2>Project Inspiration</h2>
            <p>The inspiration for this project comes from Ira Pathak, who, despite being a top-ranked fencer, struggled with the recruiting process. This app aims to bridge that gap for international athletes.</p>

        <section class="mt-4">
            <h2>What It Does</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Gives Athletes Exposure:</strong> Players can showcase their skills, stats, and practice tapes to recruiters.</li>
                <li><strong>Organizes Recruitment:</strong> Coaches get a centralized platform to manage and evaluate talent.</li>
                <li><strong>Provides Statistical Data:</strong> Advanced analytics help measure a player's impact on a team.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Defining our problem space, scraping inconsistent data from the FIE website, and managing workloads were key challenges. Overcoming them emphasized teamwork and adaptability.</p>
        </section>
        
        <section class="mt-4">
            <h2>Accomplishments</h2>
            <p>We successfully scraped fencing data, applied new libraries, and built a unique solution that has no direct competitors.</p>
